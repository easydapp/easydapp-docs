# IC Call Module

## Module Functionality

The IC Canister Call Module is designed for interacting with Internet Computer (IC) Canister smart contracts in DApps. By configuring the Canister ID and methods, along with the built-in code editor, users can flexibly invoke on-chain methods, supporting both anonymous and wallet-specified operations.

---

## Module Features

1. **Multiple Trigger Modes (Trigger by)**:
   - **Loading**: Triggers requests as the DApp loads. If `Caching Data` is enabled, cache duration can be set.
   - **Clock**: Triggers requests at fixed intervals (supports 10s, 20s, 30s, 60s). `Is Show Loading` can be enabled to display the loading status.
   - **Click**: Triggers requests via button clicks.
     - **C Mode**: Directly define button text.
     - **R Mode**: Dynamically display button text by referencing variables.

2. **Anonymous and Wallet Calls**:
   - Supports anonymous calls (`Anonymous`) by default.
   - If a wallet module is connected to the data flow, wallet-based calls can be enabled by toggling the wallet switch.

3. **Dynamic or Static Canister ID Configuration**:
   - **Refer**: Reference a variable from the data flow as the Canister ID.
   - **Const**: Manually input a static Canister ID.
   - **Candid Auto-Parsing**: Automatically retrieves the Canister's public Candid interface file and supports method selection.
   - **Candid Upload**: If the interface file is unavailable, upload the Candid file via the `Upload Candid` button.

4. **Code Assistance**:
   - Both Request and Response sections support a built-in code editor.
   - Includes IC-specific type conversion methods to simplify the development process.

5. **Data Output**:
   - Module output can be customized to specific data types, which must match the return type of the response handling code.

## User Guide

### 1. Module Setup

#### Add the Module

- Drag the IC Canister Call module into the workspace.

#### Configure Trigger Mode

- Choose a trigger mode based on business logic:
  - **Loading**: Trigger requests when the DApp loads.
  - **Clock**: Set a fixed interval to trigger requests.
  - **Click**: Trigger requests via button clicks.

#### Configure Identity Mode

- **Anonymous Mode**: Default mode enabling anonymous calls to Canister methods.
- **Wallet Mode**:
  - If a wallet module is connected, toggle the wallet switch to select the wallet as the call identity.

#### Configure Canister ID

- **Refer Mode**: Reference a variable from another module as the Canister ID.
- **Const Mode**: Manually input the Canister ID.
- **Candid Configuration**:
  - Automatically retrieves the public Candid interface file and lists available methods in the `Methods` dropdown.
  - If unavailable, upload the file via the `Upload Candid` button.

#### Configure Request Body

- **Request Body**:
  - Use the built-in code module to write custom request logic in the editor.
  - The code supports IC-specific type conversion methods, such as `Principal.fromText()`.

#### Configure Response Handling

- **Response Handling**:
  - Process the on-chain returned data in the code editor.
  - Simplify development using IC type conversion utilities.

### 2. Data Output

- The module's output consists of processed response data.
- Output type must align with the return type in the response handling code. Supported types include:
  - **String**, **Integer**, **Boolean**, **Array**, **Object**, etc.

---

## Parameter Constraints and Rules

1. **Trigger Modes**:
   - Select a trigger mode suited to the scenario to avoid excessive requests.
   - In Clock mode, set reasonable intervals.

2. **Canister ID Configuration**:
   - Ensure the Canister ID input or referenced variable is valid.
   - Uploaded Candid files must meet required specifications.

3. **Code Editing Considerations**:
   - Request body and response handling code must match the input and output formats of the Canister method.
   - Use built-in type conversion methods to streamline parameter and result processing.

4. **Output Type Matching**:
   - Ensure the `Output` configuration aligns with the response code's return type.

## Examples

### Example 1: Query Balance

- **Trigger Mode**: Click

- **Identity Mode**: Anonymous

- **Canister ID**: `abcd-efgh-ijkl`

- **Method**: `icrc1_balance_of`

- **Request Body**:

```typescript
export const main = (data: { owner: string }): object => {
  const result = {
    owner: Principal.fromText(data.owner),
    subaccount: [],
  };
  return result;
};
```

- **Response Handling**:

  ```typescript
  export const main = (response: any): string => {`
    `return Balance: ${response.balance};`
  `};
  ```

  

**Output**ï¼šBalance: 1000

- ## Notes

  1. **Trigger Mode Selection**:
     - When using the **Loading** mode, ensure the cache settings are appropriate.
     - For **Clock** mode, set reasonable intervals to avoid excessive requests.

  2. **Canister Configuration**:
     - Ensure the **Canister ID** and method are valid.
     - If the methods cannot be parsed, verify that the uploaded **Candid file** is correct.

  3. **Request and Response Consistency**:
     - The request body and response handling code must align with the interface definition.

  4. **Type Conversion**:
     - Utilize built-in IC type conversion methods such as `Principal.fromText`.
